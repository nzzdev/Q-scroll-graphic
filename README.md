## Configuration

There is one env variable `IMAGE_SERVICE_URL` to be defined. It should contain a URL with 3 parameters that will get replaced before the URL is used to load the images.
`{key}` will be replaced by the string Q-server stored as the key when the file got uploaded through Q-servers `/file` endpoint provided by the [file plugin](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-server/blob/dev/plugins/file/index.js)
`{width}` is replaced by the width the image should be loaded
`{format}` will be `png` or `webp`
Example: `https://q-images.nzz.ch/{key}?width={width}&format={format}`

## Development

Start the Q dev server:

```
npx @nzz/q-cli server

### Use the provided docker images

1. Deploy `nzzonline/q-scroll-graphic` to a docker environment
2. Set the ENV variables as described in the [configuration section](#configuration)

## Functionality

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

Here are all features listed which will have an impact on the tool but are not options. For example spacing issues. If there's a visual aspect, a printscreen would be nice.
